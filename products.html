              <h2>Microlenses</h2>
              <p>Your very own personal microscope that fits in your pocket - truly a insipring creation. Wondering how the surface of a leaf looks like? Or the microfibers in the shirt you're wearing? Our 3D-printed microlenses are capable of enlarging your desired object by 100 times - and are sure to satisfy your "spark"ing curiosity for the minute details of life.</p>

          <h2>Gravity Chair</h2>
          <p>Stable and down-to-earth - just as its name implies, our Gravity Chair "spark"s among our most creative products yet. It's certainly the best choice for any occasion, you name it - parties, picnics or even a round of Musical Chairs! When you're not using it, it's also camouflaged - compliments of our Achievers - as an inconspicuous (but still very "spark"ingly attractive) ... book.</p>

          <h2>Acrylic Coasters</h2>
          <p>The perfect embodiment of precision laser-cutting and aesthetics, our beautifully-crafted coasters are extremely useful in the heat of the moment - that is, the heat from your hot drink, of course. With our coasters, you can kick back and relax knowing your precious table is safe when you accidentally spill that cup of "spark"ing hot tea.</p>

            <p>Do messy and unorganised stationary items "spark" your irritation? If your answer is yes, this is the product for you. Want one? Why not have two, three or as many as you want of our vintage-looking drawers - you can stack them, or arrange them however you want! With these, rest assured that your stationary will be "spark"ing a whole new look!</p>

            <p>Missing the beach? We at Spark Enterprise have the perfect solution for you. We aren't too sure either how the little fish, shells and plants managed to find their way in, but they definitely make our individually-unique fridge magnets a much more memorable reminder of the sand and sea. Having one of them on your kitchen fridge will no doubt "spark" up the atmosphere!</p>

            <p>Certainly not your ordinary file. Well, just the front of it, if you're being picky. Now with a clipboard at the back, our file is the one thing students have always wanted - but everyone else is welcome too! We at Spark Enterprise believe that our multipurpose file is not to be missed on your "spark"ful journey in life and we sincerely hope "Spark" is written all over it!</p>
